Node Test BDD is a Gherkin/Cucumber syntax integration for Node.js. 


It is designed to be a drop in replacement for [Mocha Cakes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha-cakes-2) if you are using the [Node test runner](https://nodejs.org/api/test.html#test-runner) instead of [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/).

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev @bonniernews/node-test-bdd
```
